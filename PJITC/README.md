### PJITC / ITEC Data Security

The Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) Data Services portfolio provides best effort IP-based services across the DoD enterprise based on the classification level of the information accessible, including Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret and Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI).

SBU IP Data provides point-to-point connectivity to DISA mission partners. This unclassified IP data service for internet connectivity and information transfer supports Department of Defense (DoD) applications such as e-mail, web services, and file transfer. The SBU IP Data service also provides DoD customers with centralized and protected access to the public internet. NIPRNet provides support to SBU IP Data telecommunication services for combat support applications to the DoD, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Military Departments (MILDEPS), Combatant Commands (COCOM), and senior leadership. It provides seamless, interoperable, common user IP services to customers with access data rates ranging from 56 kilobits per second (Kbps) to 2.4 gigabits per second (Gbps) via direct connections to a NIPRNet router, and services to the Tactical community via Integrated Tactical-Strategic Data Network /Standard Tactical Entry Point (ITSDN/STEP) sites. It also provides access to the internet through controlled Internet Access Points.

The NIPRNet Hardening program is a Defense-in-Depth Information Assurance (IA) and Computer Network Defense (CND) effort designed by DISA to satisfy some, but not all, of the requirements specified by CJCSM 6510.0. The NIPRNet Hardening Program consists of several projects that together will improve the defensive posture of all unclassified DoD networks. The Web Content Filter (WCF) program is one of the associated NIPRNet hardening programs. WCF provides boundary protection at the application layer for web (HTTP/HTTPS) traffic and provides URL filtering for requests and malware filtering on responses. WCF program efforts will assure mission execution in the face of cyber-attack by reducing the NIPRNet attack surface and improving information to attack diagnosis, detection, and response (A2DR) systems. The WCF will provide uniform protections for clients against web vulnerabilities. This unclassified IP data service for internet connectivity and information transfer supports DoD applications such as email, web services, and file transfer. The SBU IP Data service also provides DoD mission partners with centralized and protected access to the public internet. This service supports up to and including SBU security classification.

In addition, the NIPRNet Federated Gateway (NFG) architecture implements enterprise capabilities that support additional DoD-wide solutions that protect against dangerous protocols, secure DoD-wide Domain Name Service (DNS), and secure enterprise-wide support to the teleworking workforce. This creates a clear boundary between DoD and others; enables improved sharing with key partners; and focuses cyber-attack detection, diagnosis, and reaction on the most important DoD missions. This gives DoD some ability to maneuver at the boundary in response to cyber-attacks.

#### PJITC
The Pacific JITC is the Military Health System's (MHS's) research center for joint concept technology development, prototyping, and piloting of IT products and services to support the Department of Defense (DoD) medical readiness requirements and IT modernization needs across the medical continuum of care. The Pacific JITC is composed of two major components: The Integrated Test and Evaluation Center (ITEC), and the Biotechnology Hui.  

Based in Hawaii, the mission of Pacific JITC is to rapidly research, test and develop warfighter medical solutions and products through pilots or prototypes that provide mission critical value and actionable information to the DoD, including the Services, Combatant Commanders, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

#### PJITC/ITEC
Located in Kihei, HI, the Pacific JITC’s Integrated Test and Evaluation Center (ITEC) is the first DoD/VA integrated lab to virtualize  mission-critical enterprise systems. This center provides an agile computing environment that supports military health and interagency research & development, testing, and evaluation missions.  

The ITEC provides the infrastructure to support projects focused on piloting, prototyping, and proof of concept to refine requirements. This allows the customer to focus efforts on the applications rather than the necessary IT infrastructure/environment. Providing a rapidly deployable, least constrictive, yet secure, environment, the ITEC is capable of being the compute resource for both short- and long-term projects.
