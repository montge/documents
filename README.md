![VDP Components Overview](/images/vdp-overview.png)


## Objective and Method of Delivery

__What?__

 >__Provide a single comprehensive security-enabled read/write data model for all VA VISTA data  across all VA VISTA operational systems__, establishing a common technical foundation  for __master data management__  and computable data representation and __exchange between VA and DoD clinical information systems__. --- PWS 1.1

__Where?__

>__All artifacts and deliverables__ shall be developed, version-controlled, stored, and delivered on an industry-standard __public Github__ repository (“Project Repository”). ... The Project Repository shall contain the one and only authoritative version of all artifacts produced ... The government, all necessary stakeholders, and the __public__ shall have full read and download access of all artifacts on the Project Repository at all times --- PWS 1.6.15.1

Notes:

  * Enumerated above are 27 technical deliverables within four tracks ( _VDM_, _MVDM_, _MVDMmap_, and _Infrastructure_).
  * Deliverables E1-4 are required but not explicitly enumerated in the PWS.
  * Deliverable #’s have gaps. The following PWS deliverables were retired as redundant or out of scope per government determination: 6, 16, 17, 20-24, 26, 27, 29-31, 34, 37, 38
  * There is a substantial difference in complexity between read-only and read-write models and implementations. To write anything demands knowledge of rules that go beyond the demands of reading. As a result, both VDM and MVDM models and packages will be delivered in two phases, with read coming first. 
    * VDM "Read" and its package (#7.1 and #E1.1) are due in Q1; Deliverables #8, #15, #18, #19, #25, #33 only require such read-only functionality and are due in Q2
    * MVDM "Read" and its module (#10.1 and #11.1) are due in Q2: Deliverables #28, #36 and all of track D rely only on MVDM ("Read").
    * Read-only VDM and by extension MVDM will expand on open source [FMQL](https://github.com/caregraf/FMQL)
